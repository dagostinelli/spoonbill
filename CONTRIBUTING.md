# Contributions to spoonbill

I'd love to accept your contribution.  Unfortunately, I don't have a CLA and I need to have a CLA in place to accept your contributions. For now, open an issue, describe about the idea in words, and I'll implement the code modifications myself.

Until then!

Thank you for thinking about contributing to spoonbill.
